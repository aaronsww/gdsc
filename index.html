        Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) are community groups for college
        and university students interested in Google developer technologies.
        Students from all undergraduate or graduate programs with an interest in
        growing as a developer are welcome. By joining a GDSC, students grow
        their knowledge in a peer-to-peer learning environment and build
        solutions for local businesses and their community.
